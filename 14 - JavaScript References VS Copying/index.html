    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let num = 100;
    let num2 = num;
    console.log(num, num2); // num = 100, num2 = 100
    num = 200;
    console.log(num, num2); // num = 200, num2 = 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log("team is a copy of players by assignment", players, team); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'] and ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Chris";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log("updating one of them", players, team); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Chris'] and ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Chris']

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // team2 is a new array with a similar content to players, but can be modified independently
    team2[3] = 'John';
    console.log("slice method", players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // team3 is a new array with a similar content to players, but can be modified independently

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // team4 is a new array with a similar content to players, but can be modified independently

    // or...
    const team5 = Array.from(players) // team5 is a new array with a similar content to players, but can be modified independently

    // now when we update these, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 10;
    console.log(person, captain); // both got their age updated

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 50});
    console.log(person, cap2); // only cap2 got the age updated

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread UPDATED!!! IT'S NOW WORKING!!!
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.age = 99;
    console.log(person, cap3); // only cap3 got the age updated

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: "Wes",
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: "@wesbos",
        facebook: "wesbos.developer"
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); // only separates the first level (name & age), not the socials
    dev.age = 50;
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    console.log(wes, dev); // coolman appears on both :(

    // although there's a sneaky way with JSON:
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.age = 30;
    wes.social.twitter = '@wesbos'
    console.log(wes, dev2); // coolman appears on both :(
